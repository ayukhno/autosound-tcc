"""How this app runs a command it only wants an ANSWER from.

Every probe TCC makes — `claude auth status`, `agy models`, a `--version`, the skill's checker —
is a child process started from a window. Two things about that are not obvious and both bite on
one platform only:

**stdin.** A CLI that finds a terminal on its stdin may wait for input. Started from a GUI it
inherits whatever the parent had, which on Windows is nothing useful and on macOS may be the
terminal the app was launched from. A probe that waits for a keypress nobody will make is a probe
that times out, and eight of those in a row is a panel that appears to hang (measured here,
2026-08-19: an installation report that takes 2.7 s from a shell took over 9 s from the window).

**A console window.** On Windows, a GUI process starting a console program gets a black window
flashed on screen for the duration — once per probe. `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` is the documented way to
say "this one has no user interface"; on every other platform the flag does not exist and this is
an empty dict.

Deliberately NOT used by `core/terminal_launcher`: that one's whole purpose is to open a terminal
the person can see and type in.
