"""How this app runs a command it only wants an ANSWER from.

Every probe TCC makes — `claude auth status`, `agy models`, a `--version`, the skill's checker —
is a child process started from a window. Two things about that are not obvious and both bite on
one platform only:

**stdin.** A CLI that finds a terminal on its stdin may wait for input. Started from a GUI it
inherits whatever the parent had, which on Windows is nothing useful and on macOS may be the
terminal the app was launched from. A probe that waits for a keypress nobody will make is a probe
that times out, and eight of those in a row is a panel that appears to hang (measured here,
2026-08-19: an installation report that takes 2.7 s from a shell took over 9 s from the window).

**A console window.** On Windows, a GUI process starting a console program gets a black window
flashed on screen for the duration — once per probe. `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` is the documented way to
say "this one has no user interface"; on every other platform the flag does not exist and this is
an empty dict.

Deliberately NOT used by `core/terminal_launcher`: that one's whole purpose is to open a terminal
the person can see and type in.

    The Claude Agent SDK starts the `claude` CLI through `anyio.open_process`, and passes no
    creation flags. On Windows that is a console program started by a windowed process, so the
    system gives it a console — which on Windows 11 means a Windows Terminal window jumping in
    front of the app every time a session starts (user, on Windows 11, 2026-08-19: "вілітають
    вікна терміналу"). Piping stdin/stdout does not prevent it; only the flag does.

    We do not own that call, so the default is moved underneath it: `anyio.open_process` keeps its
    signature and gains `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` unless a caller asked for something. Both names are
    replaced — the one the SDK calls (`anyio.open_process`) and the one `anyio.run_process` calls
    (its defining module) — and the wrapper marks itself, so calling this twice does nothing.

    `subprocess` is patched too, and the terminal launcher opts OUT of it by asking for a console
    explicitly (`wants_a_console()`). That is the way round it has to be: every call site here
    already passes `quiet()`, and the flashes a user still sees on Windows come from the ones that
    CANNOT -- a grandchild. The agent CLI runs the method's own `python3` and `git`, and a console
    program started by a console-less parent gets a console of its own. A default that has to be
    remembered at each call site is a default that will be forgotten; this one is the process's.
    (User, Windows 11, 2026-08-22: a terminal window blinked before the main window, again after
    it, and once more on opening the version panel -- with every call site in this repo already
    passing `quiet()`.)
