# Changelog

What changed in Autosound TCC, the desktop app for the
[autosound-tuning](https://github.com/ayukhno/autosound-tuning-skill) method. The app is installed
from `main` by the method's own installer, so a version here marks a point worth referring back to
rather than a thing anybody downloads separately.

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-08-19 · updating from inside the window

### Added

- **"Update TCC" and "Update the method", in the Installation tab** (`core/updates.py`), with the
  answer to "is there a newer one" beside each. The two halves install differently, so they update
  differently. The method is a shallow checkout parked on a release tag: TCC fetches the newest
  `v3.*` and checks it out itself, the way the installer does, in about a second — and refuses on
  any checkout that is on a branch or has uncommitted changes, because that is somebody's own work,
  not an installed release. TCC's own update is handed to a terminal the person can watch: it
  cannot replace the files of the process doing the asking — on Windows the running `.exe` and its
  loaded DLLs are locked and `uv` would fail halfway — so the window says the one thing that
  matters, close TCC first. TCC is compared by **commit**, not version: it installs from the
  default branch, so a build three days of fixes behind still calls itself 0.1.1.
- "Could not ask GitHub" is a state of its own, and never reads as "up to date".

### Fixed

- **Buttons nobody had given a class to came out grey-on-grey in the dark theme** and read as
  disabled — the omp catalogue dialog's Ok/Cancel/"Configure omp…" (a QDialogButtonBox, so the
  message-box rule never reached it) and the `models…` button in the model strip (user's
  screenshot). The platform draws a light button while this sheet has already told its children to
  use light text. There is now a base rule for the type, so the next unclassed button is right by
  default instead of by being noticed.

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-08-19 · what the first Windows tester found

A day of the beta being used on a machine we cannot see. Every item here is something that made
the app harder to report on, or a claim of ours that turned out to be wrong.

### Fixed

- **A terminal window jumped in front of the app at every AI session** (Windows). It is the Agent
  SDK's own `claude` process: it is started through `anyio.open_process` with no creation flags, so
  Windows gives a console program started by a windowed app a console — piping its input and output
  does not prevent that, only `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` does. TCC does not own that call, so the default is
  moved underneath it once at startup (`core/child.py`). Two more children had been missed: the omp
  session, which is driven through its own stdin, and the project panel's `git`. `subprocess` itself
  is deliberately untouched — the terminal launcher opens a window because somebody asked for one.
- **The REW indicator now says which REW has an API.** The one thing on screen at the moment it
  fails: the API is in REW's beta builds only, and the release version (V5.31.3) has no API tab at
  all — which is what a web search hands you.

### Added

- **Both versions in the title bar** — `(TCC 0.1.1 · skill 3.0.7)`, from the same reader the
  Installation tab uses. The title bar is in every screenshot anybody sends.
- **A Logs tab in the repair window, with a copy button.** The end of the log file and the path it
  came from, re-read every time the tab is opened, and the path travels with the copied text — a log
  with no filename is one nobody can ask about again.

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-08-19 · the beta the first outside tester gets

Forty-five commits since v0.0.4, and most of them are one line of work: **the curve window stopped
being a viewer and became the place a change is decided before it is typed into the DSP.** Beside
that, the app installs and runs from scratch on a clean Mac and on Windows 11.

Still a beta, and the README says so: what it has not had is a full tune driven end to end from
the window. The method in a terminal is the proven path.

### Added

- **The predicted sum of N drivers** (`core/curve_sum.py`). The complex sum of every plotted
  measurement, with each driver's proposed delay, gain, polarity and all-pass applied — so a guess
  costs nothing and only the accepted one is typed in and re-swept. It carries its own precondition
  everywhere it is shown: all inputs must be sweeps from one DSP config version (`_N`), a mixed set
  is labelled as a sum of two different cars rather than drawn quietly, and the one assumption no
  measurement can settle — that the operator set a shared time offset that day — is printed with
  every result.
- **An all-pass per driver, APF1 and APF2** (`core/allpass.py`, SCR-050). Dialled on the driver the
  radio has chosen and applied to the measured trace: the phase rotates around `f0`, the level does
  not move, and the predicted sum answers while the number is being typed. The filter comes from
  the skill's own `dsp_math` through `vendor_loader` — never a second copy here, because two
  implementations of one filter is how a front-end and a method start disagreeing about what a
  proposal means.
- **The delay bank carries the all-pass beside the delay.** A filter dialled on one driver comes
  back with it wherever it is next plotted, is counted once per driver on the button, and leaves
  in the same sentence — with its own caveat: simulated on the sweeps in hand, never verified by a
  summation sweep.
- **As many curves as the tuner names, with the glossary's own groups** (`core/curve_groups.py`):
  the woofers, a whole side, sub+woofers. One visible selection as a chip row — the Advisor's rule,
  after two ways of choosing had come to disagree — with groups and `_N` as a fill shortcut.
- **A strip under the impulse and the phase** carrying the sum, with each driver drawn thin beneath
  it and a draggable boundary that is remembered.
- **A way to omp's own setup from the model screen**, opened in the user's terminal, with the
  catalogue re-read when they come back.

### Changed

- **Markers are a constant pair**, whatever is plotted, and read as a table: each marker's position
  and what every trace is doing there, then the deltas — with the row in the marker's colour and the
  column in the trace's.
- **Delays are proposed as differences.** A set dragged onto a common arrival used to be sent as
  +10.690 / +10.670 / +10.000; only the differences were ever measured, so the set is normalised on
  the way out and names the driver it is stated from.
- **Every route is prefixed in every picker** — SDK, AGY, CODEX, OMP — including the opening screen,
  which used to print a bare name for anything that was not the SDK.
- **A route whose CLI is missing is greyed and says what it needs**, instead of being absent: an
  option that is not in the list reads as one that does not exist.

### Fixed

- **Two pyqtgraph segfaults**, both measured rather than guessed: one at construction (an empty
  menu) and one at teardown (0 crashes in 40 runs against 4 in 40).
- **A frequency axis that ran to 10^308 Hz**, from two causes — `updateLogMode` ending in a bare
  `enableAutoRange`, and `setXLink` being two-way and aligning by screen geometry.
- **The opening screen offered the generator's list as the critic**, so the reviewer this method is
  built around — a model from a different vendor — could not be chosen on the screen that asks for
  it. It also now warms the CLI catalogue that list is built from, which on a fresh machine is
  empty until something asks.

## [v0.0.4] and earlier

Not tracked here. The window itself, the DSP tree, the plan and measurement panels, the AI dialog,
the MCP server and the two adapters were built before this file existed; `git log` is the record.
